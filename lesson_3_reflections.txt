When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - when you want to collaborate with other developpers
 - when you want to publish your work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - because working requires some stabiliy (sometimes at least)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  clones -> copy the repo to your local hard drive
  branches -> allows to make a dev in the same repo aside existing version
  fork -> allows to take a remote repo and build your own remote repo where several developers can colaborate
